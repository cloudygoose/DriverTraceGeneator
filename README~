You can run gene.sh to enjoy the whole process, it requires you to install ant to compile with my build.xml

The DataGeneator is written in JAVA, it takes these files as input:
registration.txt
map.xml
readingnodeoutput.txt
camera-locations.txt

The DataGeneator will have two phases:
The whole process can be found in datagen/DataGen.java/main()
The first is to generate normal routes and random routes, which is done by
		router.doooo1();
		router.doooo2();
The Result is the DoublePassFilterOutput.txt and NoFilterOutput.txt
Then the datagen will grab routes from these output routes and generate traces.
LegalOutput.txt is the traces from the normal drivers.
IllegalOutput.txt is the traces from the imposters.
NoiseOutput.txt is the noie.
Finally
output is final data.
pureOutput is the final data without noise.
They can be found in outputDir/
